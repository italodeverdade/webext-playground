# WebExt - Playgrounds

This repository contains a collection of web extension playgrounds. Each playground is a separate web extension that demonstrates a specific feature or technique. The goal is to provide a set of examples that can be used as a reference for building your own web extensions with real-scenario applications.

### Playgrounds
